	<p><b>The Labrador Retriever</b> was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as a fisherman’s helper: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.</p>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Labradors are a medium-large breed, with males typically weighing 65–80 lb (29–36 kg) and females 55–70 lb (25–32 kg).[18] The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever.Labrador Retrievers are registered in three colours:black(a solid black colour), yellow (considered from cream to fox-red), and chocolate (medium to dark brown). Some dogs are sold as silver pure-bred Labradors, but purity of those bloodlines is currently disputed by breed experts including breed clubs and breed councils.</p>
